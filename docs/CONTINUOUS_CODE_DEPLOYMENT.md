# Continuous code deployment

Part of this repo is automatically generated from our [protocol buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers) monorepo.
This enables us to keep Scaleway toolings up to date with the latest version of our APIs ([developer website](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/), soon-to-be CLI, ...).

## Generated files

Generated files and folders are located in [scaleway-sdk-go/api](../api).
They always start with the following line:

## Continuous deployment process

TODO: explains the continuous deployment process.

## Synchronization frequency

The continuous code deployment process can occur at anytime of the day, sometime many times a day.
Expect it to happen regularly.

## Any question?

If you have any question or request about the continuous code deployment process feel free to [reach us](../README.md#reach-us).
